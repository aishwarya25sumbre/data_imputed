"Digital Twin of Online Meeting Note taker", is a concept of DoWell. It can be considered as a digital identity like a live member participating in a live interactive event/meeting/session irrespective of meeting platforms. This is to make a digital replica of the Note taker, who records the essence of the meeting as  and when required or continuously. It can be proposed as a hologram, an app or a bot which will be invited as a live member in the meetings. It should be envisaged to hear and take verbatim notes with speaker identification and timestamps along with audio and video recording and screen shots / screen shares.
