# The finale of digital twin notetaker

Yes here we are at the final stage of the ideation in last two score card we could see 3 teams performing really very good which makes it more difficult for to come up with a final conclusion as there is more of confusion because the ideas presented are way to excellent to choose from.

The teams give their best and made us believe that  all it takes is the dedication to show your talent 
It always amazed us on every point on how the spirt of not giving up kept them going.
The finale is here and we are as excited as you all to see which team wins the hackathon
