## DoWell hackathon ideation phase 1.0 final review 

Dowell hackathon ideation phase 1.0 is drawing to a close and we are.closer to logic 1.1. The third and final review is currently going on. Two teams have maintained a lead from the start and they continue to top the score cards after the two reviews. It remains to be seen whether there will be a surprise winner at this late stage. All teams have shown a lot of enthusiasm through all the rounds and in particular the two top teams have exhibited a lot of understanding and smartness in putting forward new ideas to this phase. The mentors deserve special mention for the way they guided the participants, clarifying different technical issues and thereby ensuring smooth conduct of this round.. The judges are going through all the additions from the participants and final scores are getting tabulated and final score cards should be out soon. The winners will be announced soon after that.  We are expecting to launch ideation for phase 1.2 as soon this is over.
